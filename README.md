# Simple GitHub Pages Webapp

This repository contains a minimal example of a web application that can be deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

## Files

- `index.html` – main page of the webapp.
- `styles.css` – basic styling.
- `script.js` – small script to demonstrate interactivity.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
2. In your repository on GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Save. GitHub will build and deploy the site. It will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

That's it! Every push to the `main` branch will update your GitHub Pages site.
